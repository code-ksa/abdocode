## How tool references work

Plugin files use `~~category` as a placeholder for whatever tool the user connects in that category. For example, `~~chat` might mean Slack, Microsoft Teams, or any other chat tool with an MCP server.

Plugins are **tool-agnostic** — they describe workflows in terms of categories (chat, email, cloud storage, etc.) rather than specific products. The `.mcp.json` pre-configures specific MCP servers, but any MCP server in that category works.

This plugin uses `~~category` references extensively as source labels in search output (e.g. `~~chat:`, `~~email:`). These are intentional — they represent dynamic category markers that resolve to whatever tool is connected.
